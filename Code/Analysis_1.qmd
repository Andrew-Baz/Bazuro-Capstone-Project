To start I will first read in the data from the exploration that I plan to use for creating my model
```{r}
rm(list = ls())
library(tidyverse)
library(here)
library(ggfortify)
library(multcomp)
Stream = read.csv(here("Data", "Bazuro_Capstone_Final"))
```

After reading in the dataset we should check it to ensure that all variables are the correct types. Since I had to change several in the exploration I would expect to have to change several now.

```{r}
glimpse(Stream)
```
My analysis will use the `Type` and `Element` variables so I will change those to factors for later analysis.

```{r}
Stream$Element <- as.factor(Stream$Element) #changes the Element variable into a factor
Stream$Type <- as.factor(Stream$Type) #changes the Type variable into a factor
glimpse(Stream)
```
The question that I am examining is:

```{r}
mod1 = lm(Concentration_ppm ~ Type + Element, data = Stream)
```
